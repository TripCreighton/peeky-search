            <h1>Academic Research Methods</h1>
            <p>Dr. Smith works at Example Inc. and has published extensively on research methodology. She earned her Ph.D. from MIT in 2015.</p>
            <p>The study was conducted in the U.S. with participants from N.Y. and L.A. spanning various demographics.</p>

            <h2>Research Design</h2>
            <p>Following the guidelines established by Prof. Johnson et al., we employed a mixed-methods approach. The quantitative component used a 5-point Likert scale.</p>
            <p>Data collection occurred between Jan. 2023 and Dec. 2023, i.e., a full calendar year. This allowed us to account for seasonal variations, e.g., holiday effects.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
            <p>We used SPSS v.28 for statistical analysis. Results were significant at p < 0.05, which is the standard threshold in social sciences.</p>
            <p>The effect size was d = 0.45, indicating a medium effect. This aligns with previous research by Dr. Wilson et al. published in 2020.</p>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Based on our findings, we recommend that organizations adopt the proposed framework. Further research should explore applications in other contexts, such as healthcare and education.</p>
